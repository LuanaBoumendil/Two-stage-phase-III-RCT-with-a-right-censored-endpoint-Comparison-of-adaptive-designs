# Two-stage phase III randomized clinical trials with a right-censored endpoint: Comparison of frequentist and hybrid Bayesian adaptive designs

The R code for data simulations and analyses presented in the article are available here. 

We considered a two-arm parallel 1:1 RCT, based on a right-censored endpoint, to evaluate an experimental treatment compared to the control. All designs comprised a single interim analysis with an efficacy stopping rule and the possibility of sample size reassessment at this interim step. We compared through simulations the performances of the four following approaches :
